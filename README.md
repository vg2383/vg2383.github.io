Data Analytics Final Project

All code pertaining to this project can be found in the dap-project directory within this repository. To view the initial version of the MVP, please visit https://vg2383.github.io/dap-project/. To test features, load the model and then proceed to enter the text that you want to determine the similarity to. From here, the class scores generated at the bottom of the page represent the similarity to the classes of books that are currently trained. The specific names of the classes can be found in order on the drop-down menu (alongside a pre-loaded sentence from each book).
