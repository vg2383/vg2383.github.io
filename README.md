Data Analytics Final Project

This final project is split into two key phases: the initial MVP and the second iteration. 

For the initial MVP, we created a page that allows users to determine the text similarity between their own text (entered into a text box) and popular Project Gutenberg books (which we chose ahead of time). All code pertaining to this MVP can be found in the dap-project directory within this repository. To view the initial version of the MVP, please check our initial MVP details submission. The class scores generated at the bottom of the page represent the similarity to the classes of books that are currently trained. The specific names of the classes can be found in order on the drop-down menu (alongside a pre-loaded sentence from each book). 

For the second iteration, we wanted to enable the user to upload their own files and engage with their own classification labels. Here, we introduced the separation of services and our data store. Users can upload their files on one page and then engage with testing again on another page. All code pertaining to this version of the product can be found at dap-project directory to test features, upload files, load the model and then proceed to enter the text that you want to determine the similarity to. From here, the class scores generated at the bottom of the page represent the similarity to the classes of uploaded files that were chosen.
